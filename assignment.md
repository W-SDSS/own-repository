### The story of Hachiko
Hachikō, <u>a white Akita</u>, was born on November 10, 1923, at a farm located in Ōdate, Akita Prefecture, Japan. He was one of eight purebred Akita puppies, borne through his father Oshinai and mother Goma. In January 1924, a 50-day-old Hachi was carried in a sack on a long train journey to Tokyo after Hidesaburō Ueno, a professor in the agriculture department at the Tokyo Imperial University, took Hachikō as a pet and brought him to live in Shibuya, Tokyo. Accordingly, Professor Hidesaburō Ueno chose the name Hachi because his forepaws resembled the shape of the kanji for eight. Ueno, who had no children, doted on the dog, allowing Hachi to sleep indoors and under his bed, raising him with affectionate care. Ueno would commute daily to work, and Hachikō would leave the house to greet him at the end of each day at the nearby Shibuya Station. Locals and station staff soon became familiar with the pair and observed the dog’s daily routine. The pair continued the daily routine until May 21, 1925, when Ueno did not return.

That evening, Hachikō went to Shibuya Station as usual, but Ueno never returned. The professor had suffered a cerebral hemorrhage while he was giving a lecture to his class and died subsequently.Hachikō, not understanding that his owner had died, showed up as usual in the evening and waited for Ueno’s arrival.When Ueno failed to come home, Hachikō acted distressed and sniffed and paced around Ueno’s empty house, even refusing food for days. In the weeks that followed, Ueno’s wife, Yaeko and colleagues made arrangements for the dog’s care. Hachikō was given to new caretakers numerous times, and sent to the countryside briefly, but repeatedly escaped or wandered back to the Shibuya area. Eventually, one of Ueno’s former gardeners, Kikuzaburō Kobayashi, who lived near Shibuya, took Hachikō in and provided a home close to the station. Yet Hachikō continued to travel to Shibuya Station almost daily. Each day despite weather conditions, the dog appeared in front of the station’s ticket gates, appearing precisely when the train was due at the station.

Hachikō waited for the next <u>9 years, 9 months and 15 days</u> and eventually attracted the attention of other commuters. Many of the people who visited the Shibuya train station had seen Hachikō and Professor Ueno together each day. Initial reactions from the people were not necessarily friendly. After the first appearance of the article about him in Asahi Shimbun on October 4, 1932, people started to bring Hachikō treats and food to nourish him during his wait.
